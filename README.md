# Web Dev Assignments

A curated collection of HTML and CSS practice projects completed for the Scaler School of Technology web development coursework. Each assignment focuses on a specific concept, from semantic layout and responsive design to playful animation experiments, and together they chart my progress through the first-term curriculum.

## 📚 Assignment Highlights

### Foundational HTML pages

- `about_me.html` – Personal profile page that explores semantic markup and accessible structure.
- `firstpage.html` – Introductory landing page combining headings, paragraphs, and media embeds.
- `contact_form.html` – Form elements with labels, inputs, and validation-ready structure.
- `weekend_plans.html` – Practice with lists, emphasis tags, and structured content flow.

### Components & Layout studies

- `profile_card.html` – Reusable profile component with typography and spacing exercises.
- `dog-gallery.html` – Flexbox-powered image gallery and hover states.
- `grid.html` – CSS Grid warm-up showcasing column/row templates.
- `movie_collection.html` – Card layout for media content with consistent visual rhythm.
- `recipe.html` – Structured article layout for step-by-step instructions.

### Shape drawing & animation drills

- `circle.html`, `square.html`, `rectangle.html`, `triangle.html`, `diamond.html` – CSS-only geometric shapes built with borders, transforms, and gradients.
- `ferris_wheeel.html` – Rotational animation practice (yes, three e's!) with transform origins.
- `moon_motion.html` – Keyframe animation simulating orbital motion across the viewport.

### Capstone portfolio

- `Portfolio/index.html` – Hero landing page with modular sections (About, Skills, Experiments, Projects, Contact).
- `Portfolio/styles.css` – Themeable design system with custom properties, animations, and responsive breakpoints.
- `Portfolio/script.js` – Progressive enhancement: navigation toggle, scroll-triggered effects, and theme switching.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Muneer320/Web-Dev-Assignments.git
   cd Web-Dev-Assignments
   ```
2. **Open any assignment**: drag-and-drop a `.html` file into your browser or serve the folder with a tool like the VS Code _Live Server_ extension for automatic reloads.
3. **Explore the portfolio**: launch `Portfolio/index.html` to view the multi-section showcase with interactive behaviors.

## 🧰 Tech & Concepts Covered

- Semantic HTML5 structure and accessibility-first markup
- CSS layout systems (Flexbox, Grid) and responsive breakpoints
- Custom properties, typography pairing, and theming
- CSS animations, transforms, and transitions
- Progressive enhancement with lightweight vanilla JavaScript

## 📝 Coursework Context

These exercises were completed as part of the Scaler School of Technology Web Development track. Each file represents either a lab assignment or a self-directed stretch goal to reinforce the week's module.

## 🔭 Next Steps

- Convert single-page assignments into reusable components or templates.
- Add automated HTML/CSS linting to maintain consistency across exercises.
- Document lesson-specific insights directly within each assignment file.

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

Grateful to the Scaler faculty and peers for feedback and review, to the broader open web community for the design inspiration that guided these exercises, and to Claude Sonnet 4.5 for auto-generating this README file for the repository.
